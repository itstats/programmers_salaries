## How we collected this data

Our magic script collected them courtesy of the sites mentioned.
The data has been standardized to be able to analyze and group it.
We did our best to generalize them wherever possible.

All rates are in EUR. Wherever it was necessary to convert them, it was done according
to the rate on the day of employment.
